# tailwind config file

 when tell when
processes our sauce CSS file it uses a
default configuration to do that under
the hood now this configuration dictates
the values of properties controlled by
different classes that we use in our
HTML


for example it would say that the
text - SM class would give a font size
of 0.875 Rams or text Excel would be a
font size of 1.25 rome's it would also
say things like the color red - 500
should be a specific hex code etc 

we
can also create our own Tailwind config
file to either extend those rules or add
extra classes for colors or fonts or
spacing or anything else or to change
the current ones as well 


hat this extra flag does
is create as a config file with all of
the default values that tailwind uses
under the hood included in it 


npx tailwindcss init --full

tailwind.config

if we wanted to we could change
these values right here and then if we
were to use that class it would change
how it looks
dependent on the value that we pass
through here because when we then use
tailwind to process our CSS it will look
for the values and match them up okay so
if we wanted to we could also add new
properties 


reprocess file base on new config


doesn't matter that there wasn't one
there before we never used to have this
config file when we don't have one it
just uses all of these default Styles
under the hood without this file even
being there but now we have one it's
gonna look for it and it's going to
apply all of these different values
including our new one s


npm run build-css


I wouldn't recommend changing values
inside the default config setup if you
do this it's hard to see what values
you've actually changed and what new
values you've added and therefore it's
going to be tough to distinguish between
the default values already there and
your own so instead we should create a
blank config file to extend the default
rules and that way we're not altering
the core values and it's easier to see
which extra values we've added ourselves
as well 


new blank config file

npx tailwindcss init

extend the themethat tailwind is using

```JAVASCRIPT
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, 
  theme: {
    extend: {
        colors:{
            primary: '#FF6363'
            secondary: {
                100: '#E2E2D5',
                200: '#888883',
            }
        }
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

now i can

class="bg-secondary-100 text-secondary-200"

# responsive classes

media queries?

normally when we're
creating mobile designs we'd use media
queries in our CSS file to style things
differently at different screen sizes
right now intel wind we don't have to
manually create any media queries at all
we can just prefix our tailwind classes
with responsive classes and then that
class would only apply to that screen
size and up now the responsive classes
are these right here SM MD LG and Excel
so if we prefix a class with SM it means
okay only target things from small
screens and up if we prefix it with MD
only target that class from medium-sized
screens and up now all of these
breakpoints that they use are min-width
which means this is a mobile first
approach so by default all classes that
you apply to an element will apply at
all widths including the smallest screen
sizes but then when we prefix them with
one of these things right here then
those classes would only apply for that
device width and oh 


mobile first approach

# apply directive


if we wanted to
make multiple cards or multiple budgets
we'd have to use all of these classes on
each one we created now imagine as well
if we wanted to change the style of a
card then we'd have to change it in
every place that we have a card and the
same would be true for badges so that's
not a great idea and it's also looking a
bit messy as well so instead it would be
nice if we could extract these different
classes into an external selector using
some nifty tailoring syntax and we can
do


ow anything with a class of card
is going to look at that and it's going
to apply all of these classes to it so
all I need to do now is give this a
class of card and we have a reusable
component which we only have to update
over here and not in every place we
create a card now that's a bit better
and it's also much tidier - it becomes
much more reusable

# icons

tailwind itself doesn't actually come
with any icons built into it we have to
use some kind of external library or
your own SVG's you can use whichever you
prefer now I'm going to use something
called hero icons which is really nice
it gives us all of these different icons
right here and all we have to do is
click on one for example and it copies
the SVG code for that particular icon
and then our willing to do is come to
the HTML and if I paste this in now oops
let me just paste it we can see this
thing right here this SVG so when we
clicked on this icon it copied the SVG
code for us and we've pasted it in right
here now if I save that and preview we
